I developed this website using a Game of Thrones API to obtain information and integrate it into a search bar where the user can obtain information and a photo of a character.

Technologies used in the website were .html, .css, and .javascript

Logo and font were downloaded and implemented the css as well as the background image of the Iron Throne from the series.

Some ideas to improve the site - 
1.) Improve the search function with additional filtering, such as by family name.
2.) Add more information to the JSON as the API did not obtain as much information as it could have/what is available fromm the series or books.
