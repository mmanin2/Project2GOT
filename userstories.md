*USER STORIES*

AS an avid fan of the original Game of Thrones television series, I WANT TO become more familiar with the characters of the show SO THAT I will regain some lost knowledge of characters and be better prepared before the new spin-off series comes out on HBO.

AS a new fan of the shows/books, I WANT TO put the faces to the names of characters and see who are a part of which family, SO THAT I can have a clearer understanding of the plot points as there are so many characters with the similar first and last names and similar physical features, and it can get confusing in the beginning.
